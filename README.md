• PROBLEM STATEMENT

The problem statement focuses on developing an image captioning system using LSTM neural networks. The objective is to generate accurate and meaningful captions for various images by combining computer vision and natural language processing. The challenges include semantic understanding of the visual content, language generation, handling ambiguity, accommodating variable caption lengths, and ensuring real-time inference. The proposed solution involves training an LSTM network on a large dataset of image-caption pairs to learn the mapping between visual features and textual descriptions. The success of the project will be evaluated using automated metrics and human evaluation. Overall, the project aims to advance image captioning techniques and explore the capabilities of LSTM networks in generating descriptive captions. To build the image captioning system, we plan to train an LSTM network on an extensive dataset of image-caption pairs. This dataset will contain a broad array of scenes, objects, and activities, ensuring that our model can generalize well across different visual contexts. The LSTM network will take image features, which will be extracted using pre-trained CNNs like Xception or ResNet, as its input. By processing these features through the LSTM layers, the network will learn to generate captions in a sequential manner, producing one word at a time. Additionally, we will incorporate attention mechanisms into the LSTM to allow the model to focus on relevant regions in the image while generating each word, improving the model's semantic understanding. Semantic comprehension is a critical aspect of this image captioning system. Our LSTM model needs to associate specific objects, scenes, and relationships within an image to produce meaningful captions that accurately describe the visual content. To address language generation and ambiguity, we will employ advanced techniques such as beam search or diverse sampling during caption generation. These techniques will enable our model to explore multiple possibilities and enhance the diversity and quality of the generated captions. Furthermore, we recognize that captions can vary in length, and we must handle this variability effectively. We will employ padding and masking techniques during training and inference to accommodate captions of different lengths without compromising the model's performance.

• OBJECTIVE The objective of image captioning is to develop an advanced system capable of automatically generating descriptive and coherent captions for images. This task involves integrating computer vision techniques with natural language processing to create meaningful textual descriptions that accurately represent the visual content present in an image. The primary goal is to enable machines to comprehend the semantic context of an image, recognize objects, scenes, actions, and relationships depicted, and translate this understanding into fluent and grammatically correct natural language sentences. To evaluate the success of the image captioning system, both automated metrics and human evaluation are employed. Automated metrics like BLEU, provide quantitative assessments of the quality of generated captions in comparison to ground truth captions. Real-time Inference: The image captioning system should be efficient enough to generate captions in real-time, allowing for practical use in applications that require immediate responses. Accommodating Caption Lengths: Captions for different images may vary in length. The image captioning system should be able to accommodate captions of varying lengths, adjusting the output to provide appropriate descriptions without any limitations on the caption length.

• Corpus We have used the Flickr 8K dataset as the corpus. The dataset consists of 8000 images and for every image, there are 5 captions. The 5 captions for a single image helps in understanding all the various possible scenarios. The dataset has a predefined training dataset Flickr_8k.trainImages.txt (6,000images), development dataset Flickr_8k.devImages.txt (1,000 images), and test dataset Flickr_8k.testImages.txt (1,000 images). The Images are opted from six varied Flickr groups and do not contain any well-known personality or places.[3] However, they are manually selected to show a variety of scenes.[1] These datasets(Size 1GB) can be directly downloaded.Currently, Flickr8k dataset which contains the least number of images is used as our primary data source over the other two due to our limited storage and computational power.Fig 3.3 describes the some of the Flickr8k dataset sample. Whereas, Fig 3.4 shows Glimpse of Flickr8k Text File.
